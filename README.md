The Prisoner’s Dilemma refers to the following situation: Two criminals who committed a crime together are being interrogated by the police in separate rooms. Each prisoner has a choice to either cooperate with his partner in crime and stay silent, or to be a defector and rat on his partner to gain favor with the police. The outcome of the interrogation depends on the choices made by the two prisoners:


* If both prisoners cooperate with each other and stay silent, then they each only go to prison for a short time (because there is little evidence against them).
* If both prisoners cooperate with each other and stay silent, then they each only go to prison for a short time (because there is little evidence against them).
* If both prisoners testify against each other (“D” strategies), then they both get long sentences.

The Prisoner’s Dilemma is widely studied as a model for real policy situations. Pollution is a good example: if no one pollutes (that is everyone adopts a “C” strategy), everyone does well. If everyone pollutes (all adopt a “D” strategy), we all lose. But if you live in the only country that pollutes (the only “D” country), you get the economic benefit without the global cost (a big reward for you).

The final simulation result would look like this:
